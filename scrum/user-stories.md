As an Idea Creator
I want to provide the URL's to any supporting diagrams. URL's should have a
plain text description in addition to the URL itself.
So I can quickly and easily provide reviewers with more detail about my idea
[] Define the constraints for the URL and its description
[] Define layout of these fields on the Idea screen
[] Create component to support capture, display, and edit of these fields
[] Add these fields to the database
[] Add support for maintaining this information in the various backend idea routes
